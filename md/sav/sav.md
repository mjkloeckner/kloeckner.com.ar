# SAV - Sorting Algorithms Visualized

18-09-22

This is a desktop app that shows how an array is being sorted using different algorithms.

I made it using pure C and SDL2 for graphics, you can take a look at it's source code on [Github](https://github.com/mjkloeckner/sav).

The main purpose of this app was to put in practice the knowledge I gained in C as well with algorithms, and it was like a challenge since I'd never used SDL2 graphics before. In the end was a very enjoyable project since SDL2 per se is a very simple and easy to use library.


Currently it supports the following algorithms:

* bubble sort improved
* insertion sort
* merge sort wrapper
* quick sort wrapper
* shell sort
* selection sort
* heap sort
