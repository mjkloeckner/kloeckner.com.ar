			<h2 style="color:#DAA520; text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black;">What about me?</h2>
			<p>My name is Martin, I'm from Argentina, currenly I'm staying at my parents house in a little town located at the center of Buenos Aires province. Because of the pandemic I've spend this last two years mostly seated in front of a computer, I've learned a lot about linux, embedeed systems, and also about web development, although I'm not even close of working as such, but I would like, some day.</p>

			<h4><u>Programming</u></h4>
			<p>Since I'm studying Electronics Engineering I took a couse in Algorithms &amp; Programing, in which they teach me basic programming in C, we did a simple program that parses csv files, we implemented linked lists, and more of that stuff, also the concepts of Abstract Data Types (TDA), kinda like Object Oriented Programming but in C, by the end of the course they did explained a little bit of Object Oriented Programming but that is a subject of Algorithms and Programming II, and III, which I can't take beacouse I have to pass Calculus and Physics first, so they did more like an introduccion.</p>

			<h4><u>Tech that I use</u></h4>
			<p>In terms of hardware I got a couple of computers, I got an old generic tower pc, with an intel i3 2100 and 8gb of ram which is from 2012, and a more newer 14" laptop that my mom gifted me 3 years ago, has and i3 5005u and 8gb of ram too. I've also got two old computers that its keyboard wont work, which I use as 'servers', I installed debian on them and controll'em via SSH.</p>
			<p>In terms of software I use linux in all of them lol, I've got debian in boths 'servers', artix on the tower pc, with runit as init, I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBdNQdocrVc" target="_blank">video</a> of it's boot time, and arch (btw) intalled on the laptop.</p>

			<h4><u>Whats the purpose of this website?</u></h4>
			<p>Well after watching a lot of youtube videos I've decided that it could be a good idea to make a website, to practice all this stuff that I've learned, so I made this simple webpage.</p>
