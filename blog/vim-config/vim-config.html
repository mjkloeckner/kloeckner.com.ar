			<p>If we think for a moment about software we are going to realize that the core of every program it's just plain text, literally just words in a file that someone wrote, this webpage it's just text interpreted by your web-browser, whose also just plain text implemented by another program, some software has more complexity than others, for example the linux kernel it's estimated that has around 27.8 million lines of code, which is also just plain text</p>

			<p>The way we tell computers what to do it's with text, so in order to write that text we just need a text editor and this is were Vim it's known for. Vim it's just a text editor. The term Vim stands for Vi IMproved, Vim it's a rewrite and improved version of Vi, a text editor that dates from 1978.</p>

			<p>In this article I want to show how this text editor became my best frient (?), I learned to love about Vim keybindings and now I even have and extension on my browser to use vim like keybindings.</p>

			<p>Vim is a console text editor (altough you can find distributions like gvim, which comes with a gui), a benefit of this its that It's very lightweign in terms of system resources. Vim it's also highly configurable, you can do this by editing the <u>.vimrc</u> text file, which should be in you home directory in Linux or BSD bases OSs, if not you can <u>create</u> a new blank one and start from zero</p>

			<p>If you installed Vim and you don't know how to move around or insert text, first you need to understand the basics, Vim has 3 main "modes" </p>

			<p>By default Vim comes with a lot of features disabled, for example a key binding to comment a line or auto close brackets, parenthesis, etc, this features you can enable them by installing <u>plugins</u> which I will cover leter.</p>
