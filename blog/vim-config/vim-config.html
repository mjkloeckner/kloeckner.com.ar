<p>If we think for a moment about software we are going to realize that the
core of every program is just plain text, literally, just words in a
file that someone wrote, this webpage it&#8217;s just text interpreted by
your web-browser, whose also just plain text implemented by another
program, some software has more complexity than others, for example the
linux kernel it&#8217;s estimated that has around 27.8 million lines of code,
which is also just plain text</p>

<p>The way we tell computers what to do it&#8217;s with text, so in order to
write that text we just need a text editor and this is were Vim it&#8217;s
known for. Vim it&#8217;s just a text editor. The term Vim stands for Vi
IMproved, Vim it&#8217;s a rewrite and improved version of Vi, a text editor
that dates from 1978.</p>

<p>In this article I want to show how this text editor became my best
frient (?), I learned to love about Vim keybindings and now I even have
and extension on my browser to use vim like keybindings.</p>

<p>Vim is a console text editor (altough you can find distributions like
gvim, which comes with a gui), a benefit of this its that It&#8217;s very
lightweign in terms of system resources. Vim it&#8217;s also highly
configurable, you can do this by editing the <em>.vimrc</em> text
file, which should be in you home directory in Linux or BSD bases OSs,
if not you can <em>create</em> a new blank one and start from zero</p>

<p>If you installed Vim and you don&#8217;t know how to move around or insert
text, first you need to understand the basics, Vim has 3 main &#8220;modes&#8221;</p>

<p>By default Vim comes with a lot of features disabled, for example a key
binding to comment a line or auto close brackets, parenthesis, etc, this
features you can enable them by installing <em>plugins</em> which I
will cover leter.</p>
